English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in England and is now the most widely used language in the world.
It is spoken as a first language by a majority of the inhabitants of several nations, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland,
New Zealand and a number of Caribbean nations. It is the third most common native language in the world, after Mandarin Chinese and Spanish.
It is widely learned as a second language and is an official language of the European Union, many Commonwealth countries and the United Nations, as well as
in many world organisations.
English arose in the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of England and what is now south-east Scotland, but was then under the control of the kingdom of Northumbria.
Following the extensive influence of Great Britain and the United Kingdom from the 17th century to the mid-20th century, via the British Empire,
and of the United States since the mid-20th century, it has been widely propagated around the world, becoming the leading language of
international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions.
Historically, English originated from the fusion of closely related dialects, now collectively termed Old English,
which were brought to the eastern coast of Great Britain by Germanic (Anglo-Saxons) settlers by the 5th century - with the word English
being derived from the name of the Angles, and ultimately from their ancestral region of Angeln (in what is now Schleswig-Holstein).
A significant number of English words are constructed based on roots from Latin, because Latin in some form was the lingua franca of the Christian Church
and of European intellectual life. The language was further influenced by the Old Norse language due to Viking invasions in the 8th and 9th centuries.
